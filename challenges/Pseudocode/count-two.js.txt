-create a function named 'countTwos' with parameter: num
  -declare variable called 'count' and assign it 0
  -convert num param to String, then convert to Array, and assign it to numArr
  -declare a variable called 'position' and assig it the length of numArr plus 1

  -start a reverse loop, while iterator is greater than 0
    -delcare a variable called 'digit' and assign it current array value, then convert it to Number
    -declare a variable called 'place' and assign it poition
    -if place equals 1 then...
      -if digit is greaten then or equal to 2 then...
        -add 1 to count
      -else
        -add 0 to count.
      -end conditional
    -else
      -
    -end conditional
  -end of reverse iteration

-end of countTwo function
