-create a function named 'mergeRanges' with parameters: array
  -declare a variable called 'collector' and assign it an empty array
  -declare a variable called 'length' and assign it the length of the array param

  -iterate through the array param
    -declare a variable called 'condensed' and assign it an emptyArray

    -declare a variable called 'currentArray' and assign it the current array being processed

    -declare a variable called 'nextArray' and assign it the array after the currentArray
    
    -if the length of the array param is odd and the iterator equals 0 then...
      -push the currentArray to collector
      -continue to next array
    -end if

    -push the value at index 0 in the currentArray to condensed
    -push the value at index 1 in the currentArray to condensed
    -push condensed to collector
  -end of iteration

  -return collector

-end of mergeRanges function
